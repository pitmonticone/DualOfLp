# Dual of Lp

This is the repository for the project led by [Filippo A. E. Nuccio](https://perso.univ-st-etienne.fr/nf51454h/index_eng.html) at the conference [ItaLean 2025](https://pitmonticone.github.io/ItaLean2025/).

The main goal is to get your hands dirty with a little bit of Functional Analysis, in particular with the notions of
* Local Convexity
* Banach spaces and their duals.
* $L^p$ and $\ell^p$-spaces.

The main goal is to prove that the (continuous) dual of $\ell^p(\mathbb{N},\mathbb{R})$ is $0$ for every $0<p<1$: as a warm-up we first prove that $\ell^p$ is not locally convex for such exponents.

Then we generalise the same arguments to prove that $L^1([0,1])$ is not locally convex, and has trivial dual.

The blueprint follows [the nice note](https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/analysis/lpspace.pdf) " $L^p$-spaces for $0<p<1$ " by Keith Conrad: I thank him for some exchanges and for his permission to steal this material.
